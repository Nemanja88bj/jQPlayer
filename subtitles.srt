So, if you have been paying attention to chatter on the Internet these

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,710
days, especially geeky chatter, you may have heard the term HTML5.

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,750
Well what is that?

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,670
HTML stands for, uhhh forget it, but its the behind the scenes coding language that makes

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,050
us able to see stuff online.

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,070
Since the original HTML was invented with the web over 20 years ago, it has gone through

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,329
many updates, but its been more than a decade since the last one, and in web terms that&#39;s

8
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:29,689
pretty much forever. I mean like 10 years ago we all still loved our digital watches.

9
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,269
&quot;Oh wow, a calculator!&quot;

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,260
So HTML has been a few steps behind changes

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,370
on the web for quite some time. For example, when video came along, there was no way to

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,760
integrate it naturally into HTML, so different companies developed their own video players

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,620
to work around it. These worked OK, but they all were all external plugins, meaning that

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,240
you had to download them, and this was, well, annoying and potentially risky.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,800
HTML5 is adding capabilities to deal with

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,960
this stuff - like video - right into its code, so that plugins hopefully won&#39;t be necessary.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:00:64,140
And there&#39;s plans to add a bunch more cool stuff that previously was tricky or even impossible

18
00:00:64,140 --> 00:00:69,470
to implement with HTML alone. The overall hope is that some day it will create a standard,

19
00:00:69,470 --> 00:00:72,530
consistent web experience across all devices and browsers.

20
00:00:72,530 --> 00:00:76,310
HTML5 is still being developed, and as of

21
00:00:76,310 --> 00:00:82,490
early 2012 isn&#39;t 100% finalized, but the browsers are starting to implement some of its features,

22
00:00:82,490 --> 00:00:89,880
and together they are working hard to get HTML5 fully ready for someday in the future.
