1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,040
My husband and I grow orchids, 	

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,050
but this could be our last year. 

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,170
We've had a really difficult time.	

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,070
This is our story.

5
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,180
Orchids are like children.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,050
We spend a lot of energy looking after them,

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,110
always hoping that they will bloom and be beautiful.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,070
So â€¦

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,080
every year,

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,230
when the flowers finally open,

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,110
it makes us really happy.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,100
This is my father.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,080
He came from Hunan to help us sell the flowers.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,210
You've done it all wrong!

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,160
Oh, no wonder.  He was drinking Baijiu today.

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,170
This is our cat, that has yet to catch a single rat.

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,060
And this is me.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,000
Chinese New Year is our most important festival.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,070
Everybody buys beautiful flowers to celebrate.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,110
This year, Winter has been much colder than usual,

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,170
and I am even more afraid of power cuts.

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,070
Now â€¦

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,110
all of our equipment relies on electricity -

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,050
from the fans and heaters

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,070
to the fly nets and awnings -

26
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,200
everything depends on electricity.

27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,230
My husband is a bit paranoid.

28
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,060
It has been a really cold year,

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,080
so he has nightmares of power cuts.

30
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,050
Two years ago,

31
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,100
we lost 20,000 orchids in a single day.

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,060
He spent a fortune on an oil-powered generator,

33
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,190
just in case.

34
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,150
Now that we have a full stock,

35
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,000
a day-long power cut like that could finish us.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,100
So he still wakes up in the middle of the night,

37
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,010
scared that our business is gone.

38
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,030
It's better for me to sell lots of orchids at once.

39
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,200
But most of our customers are just normal people,

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,040
wanting one or two pots for their home.

41
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,130
Our wholesale customers simply aren't coming.

42
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,040
We keep calling them,

43
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,100
asking when they will come,

44
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:15,150
but they haven't responded yet,

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,150
And so we wait.

46
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,010
In this industry, the selling period is very brief.

47
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,120
It's all concentrated just before Chinese New Year.

48
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,120
So this is our most important time.

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,140
We work so hard all year,

50
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,230
just to be able to sell the flowers now.

51
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,160
So this is an incredibly critical time for us.

52
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,090
We still have so many flowers in the greenhouse.

53
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,110
I am getting really worried that we won't sell them all.

54
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,230
Although I'm reluctant to admit it,

55
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,200
I am worried too.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:59,120
Chinese New year is just two days away,

57
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,050
and although this year we have more flowers than ever,

58
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,210
it's been very cold.

59
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,000
And we haven't been able to sell them.

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,240
The past couple of days have been a bit warmer,

61
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,160
but we could still lose it all and have to move back to Taiwan.

62
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,010
Which one do you want?

63
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,230
Get me that list!

64
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,040
seven, eight, nine, ten â€¦

65
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,160
Here, you take her.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,070
35 yuan each!

67
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,100
You can buy a few more pots - no problem!

68
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,060
Fill the truck!  Fill the truck!

69
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,130
Don't waste the petrol money!

70
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,110
The flowers are selling now because the weather is better,

71
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,130
and we've also had no problems with the electricity.

72
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,200
I'm over the moon!  So so happy!

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,000
I remember when we sold our last flower.

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,060
I really couldn't believe we had done it.

75
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,040
I thought this was going to be our last year.

76
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,160
Cheers!

77
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,010
My husband's oil-powered generator.

78
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,050
We haven't used it yet.
